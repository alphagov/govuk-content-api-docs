GOV.UK Content API makes it possible to access the data used to render content
on [https://www.gov.uk](https://www.gov.uk) (hereafter referred to as GOV.UK).
For any page hosted on GOV.UK you can [use the path](#quick-start) to access
the content and associated metadata for a page.

GOV.UK Content API is accessed via [HTTP][] and returns data in a [JSON][]
format. The [reference documentation](reference.html) details the
endpoints and the response format.

## What you can do with this API

This API is useful for applications that incorporate content from GOV.UK and
for keeping that content up to date. It provides a more accessible and
predictable interface than what can be achieved through scraping HTML pages.

You can navigate between content within this API by utilising links. For
example, for a page you could access the government organisation that published
the page and then navigate to feature policies of that organisation.

## What you can't do with this API

The content within this API is limited to pages hosted on
[`www.gov.uk`](https://www.gov.uk) and does not include other websites that are
subdomains of `gov.uk`.

This API includes only the pages on GOV.UK that are available as HTML and does
not allow direct access to attachments or images. These files however are
associated with their HTML content and can be accessed.

Not all content is available. For example, content that is generated
dynamically (such as through a search) is not available. Some types of content
may still be being migrated to utilise this API and these could appear
as placeholder documents without any content or as redirections to a
catch-all content item that represents a group of unmigrated content.

If you wish to access historic content this can currently be done
through the [National Archives][].

## Who can use this API

Anyone can use this API for any purpose. There is no need for onboarding or
signing any agreements. Please note that this API is currently in beta.

## Beta software

GOV.UK Content API is currently beta software and may be subject to changes
and improvements as we learn from usage.

This means that you may use this software and build applications that utilise
it. However as we learn from feedback we may make changes to the software.

## Quick start

You can use the GOV.UK Content API to look up the data that is used to
render content on GOV.UK.

To get started:

 1. Pick a page on GOV.UK, for example: [https://www.gov.uk/take-pet-abroad](https://www.gov.uk/take-pet-abroad).
 2. Make a note of the path, for example: `/take-pet-abroad`.
 3. Using a tool such as [curl](https://curl.haxx.se/),
    [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/) or your web browser, make a GET
    request to [`https://www.gov.uk/api/content/take-pet-abroad`](https://www.gov.uk/api/content/take-pet-abroad).
 4. You’ll receive a JSON response and the fields for this are
    explained in the [reference documentation](reference.html).

For example, using the curl command line utility tool:

```shell
curl https://www.gov.uk/api/content/take-pet-abroad
```

Or, you can [use the govuk-browser-extension](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-browser-extension).
Note that this is intended for internal use.

## Authentication

Usage of GOV.UK Content API does not require authentication.

## Security and compliance

### Reporting vulnerabilities

If you believe there is a security issue with GOV.UK Content API, [read our security
policy](https://github.com/alphagov/.github/blob/master/SECURITY.md)
and [contact us immediately](https://github.com/alphagov/.github/blob/master/SECURITY.md#reporting-a-vulnerability).

Please don’t disclose the suspected breach publicly until it has been fixed.

### HTTPS

GOV.UK Content API follows government HTTPS security guidelines. The
Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS), which involves the Transport Layer
Security (TLS) protocol, is used by the platform to provide secure connections.

### Security patches

We treat security vulnerabilities in the platform and library code in the GOV.UK
Content API as our highest priority. The codebase will be updated as soon as
possible when vulnerabilities are discovered or reported.

We frequently upgrade the framework and library code in GOV.UK Content API
to the latest versions for security and feature enhancements.

## Rate limiting

There is a maximum limit of 10 requests per second per client. If you exceed
this your request won't be processed until the limit is no longer exceeded
and you may see timeout errors.

We think this should be sufficient for all users of GOV.UK Content API but
if you believe you need the limit increasing you can [contact support](#support).
